% ncread
%1.1 功能
%从NetCDF格式的数据源的变量中读取数据（Read data from variable in NetCDF data source）
%1.2 语法结构
%vardata = ncread(source,varname)
%vardata = ncread(source,varname,start,count,stride)
%1.3 描述
%1.3.1 vardata = ncread(source,varname)
%从数据源中读取变量名为varname的变量
%1.3.2 vardata = ncread((source,varname,start,count,stride)
%（1）start
%varname所指定变量的每一维的开始读取的位置
%（2）count
%从start指定的开始位置算起，一共读取的每一维要素的数目
%（3）stride
%从start开始，每一维读取的数目为count时，每一维的读取的步长

%WAVE is the WAVELET transform of Y. This is a complex array

%The WAVELET power spectrum is ABS(WAVE)^2.
%Its units are sigma^2 (the time series variance)
